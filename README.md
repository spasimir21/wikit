# Wikit

A wiki composed of small, interconnected informational fragments.

# Notes

> **Elasticsearch** was replaced last minute by _Neo4j's Full-Text Indexes_ to make the platform a lot faster and easier to run. All the documentation still includes it though.

> It's recommended to use _at least_ **2 - 4 GB** of **RAM** for the docker containers. ([Docker Windows Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/))
