# Wikit

A wiki composed of small, interconnected informational fragments.

# Notes

The platform might be a little slow, but it's all because of **Elasticsearch** running on one machine alongside all the other services. There shouldn't be such an issue in a real production environment.
**Elasticsearch** is a **very heavy** service and so requires a significant amount of **RAM**.
It's recommended to use _at least_ **2 - 4 GB** of **RAM** for the docker containers.
